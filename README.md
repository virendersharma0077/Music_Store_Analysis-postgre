Music Database Query Project
Project Description
This project demonstrates the use of PostgreSQL as a relational database management system to store and query data from a music-related database. The database includes tables that store information about artists, albums, tracks, genres, and playlists. Various SQL queries have been implemented to fetch meaningful insights from this music database.

Key Features:
PostgreSQL Database Setup: The project uses PostgreSQL to manage and store data efficiently.
Database Schema: The schema includes tables like artists, albums, tracks, genres, playlists, and their relationships.
SQL Queries: A series of SQL queries are written to fetch data such as:
List of all artists.
All albums by a specific artist.
Tracks within a specific genre.
Top tracks based on play counts or ratings.
Playlists associated with a user or genre.
Data Analysis: Various aggregate functions (like COUNT, SUM, AVG) are used to analyze trends, such as the most popular genre, artist, or track in the database.
Project Structure:
database_setup.sql: Script to create and populate the PostgreSQL music database.
queries.sql: Collection of SQL queries that retrieve various insights from the music database.
README.md: Documentation of the project setup and SQL queries.
Technologies Used:
PostgreSQL
SQL
Installation:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-database-query.git
Set up PostgreSQL and create a new database.

Run the database_setup.sql script to create the tables and insert sample data:

bash
Copy
psql -U username -d your_database_name -f database_setup.sql
You can then run the SQL queries from the queries.sql file to fetch and analyze the data.

Example Queries:
sql
Copy
-- Retrieve all albums by a specific artist
SELECT * FROM albums WHERE artist_id = (SELECT id FROM artists WHERE name = 'Artist Name');

-- Get top 10 tracks based on play count
SELECT title, play_count FROM tracks ORDER BY play_count DESC LIMIT 10;

-- List of all genres
SELECT DISTINCT genre FROM tracks;
